# Description

This is a proof-of-concept project that demonstrates the sequence of steps required to build a docker image in a private image registry and then to deploy this image as an application in a Raspberry Pi k3s Kubernetes cluster.

The details for the workflow are covered in my Blog Article

[Building and Deploying our own Images](https://blog.smooth-sailing.net/kubernetes/docker/imagebuild/2023-12-12-rolling-our-own-docker-images/)

If you want to run through this exercise, clone the repository into your k3s environment with

git clone https://github.com/zubeax/simple-quiz.git

and then follow the steps from the blog.
